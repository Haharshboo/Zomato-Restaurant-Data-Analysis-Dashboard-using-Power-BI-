# Zomato-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-using-Power-BI-
 an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Zomato restaurant data across 15 countries and 141 cities. 
 
 The goal of my project was to help the company make informed decisions about where to open new cloud kitchens or which restaurants to partner with. By analyzing restaurant density, cuisine demand, customer ratings, costs, and delivery options across cities and countries.

 From my project, I found that restaurant presence and customer engagement in India are highly concentrated in the Delhi NCR region, especially in New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida. Cuisines like North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food show the highest demand, based on their frequency and customer ratings. I also observed that ratings and votes are significantly higher for restaurants offering delivery services, indicating strong online-ordering behavior. These findings help identify which cities have strong market demand, which cuisines are most profitable for cloud kitchens, and which high performing restaurants would make ideal partnership candidates

 Even though the dataset from Kaggle was structured, it still needed several cleaning steps in Power Query to make it ready for analysis. I handled missing values, standardized text formats, removed duplicates, split multi-cuisine columns, converted data types like cost and ratings, and created a few calculated columns and  measures. These steps helped me ensure consistency and improve the accuracy of the analysis
